01:05 PM | CMT Pune: hi i want to downgrade from Business Web Hosting plan to Single Web Hosting

01:05 PM | Kodee from Hostinger: Please provide the Payment ID of your current Business Web Hosting plan so I can check the downgrade eligibility for you. You can find the Payment ID in your Payment History (https://hpanel.hostinger.com/billing/payment-history/paid).

01:06 PM | Kodee from Hostinger: Before proceeding with the downgrade, please review the following important points: 
 1. After downgrading, your plan limits will decrease, which may lead to reaching memory, inodes, disk, and other limits more quickly. 
2. The price of the new plan is based on its renewal price. If the new plan costs more, you will be charged the difference. 
3. If your current plan includes Daily Backups, downgrading to Single Web Hosting means you will lose those backups. 
4. If you're downgrading from a Cloud to a Web Hosting plan, your hosting IP will change. You may need to update A records or other IP-related configurations for your domain. 
 Please confirm if you would like to proceed with the downgrade.

01:11 PM | CMT Pune: yes
